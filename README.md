# Web_Visualization

Create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations already created in the Weather Analysis repository.

Website Contents

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

1) A landing page containing:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page.

2) Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3) A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page to easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  - The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

4) A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  - The table is a bootstrap table component.

The website includes, at the top of every page, a navigation menu that:
  - Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  - Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
  - Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
  - Is responsive (using media queries).
